palaver.io
=

a lucid node.js framework for building multi-room chat-applications

-

if your web application needs a multi-room chat system palaver.io is what you need, it consists of a serverside framework build on top of socket.io and will eventually include a client-side api which makes it easy to integrate a multi-room chat system into your web application

disclaimer:

the api is currently in constant development so stuff might break often until a official npm package is created
