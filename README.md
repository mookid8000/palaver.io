[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ssboisen/palaver.io.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ssboisen/palaver.io)


if your web application needs a multi-room chat system palaver.io is what you need, it consists of a serverside framework build on top of socket.io and will eventually include a client-side api which makes it easy to integrate a multi-room chat system into your web application

#disclaimer:

the api is currently in constant development so stuff might break often until a official npm package is created
